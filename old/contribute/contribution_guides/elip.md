## What is ELIP?

ELIP is an acronym for Elastos Improvement Proposal.

ELIP is a design document that provides information, describes processes, introduces new features, or the environment to the Elastos Community. At the same time, ELIP should provide concise technical specifications and a rationale for the target characteristics.

We hope that ELIP will become the main mechanism for improving Elastos technology. Every effective ELIP should be accepted by the majority in the community. Therefore, ELIP will be managed by Cyber Republic Consensus CRC. ELIP authors have a responsibility to consider community comments to revise and maintain ELIP .

## Scope

Elastos is committed to building a Smart Web Powered by Blockchain. Its infrastructure includes:

- Blockchain
- Wallet
- Network Service
- Storage Service
- Application and Runtime

Therefore, the technical scope of ELIP can be one or more of these five categories. If proposals for other technical fields need to be proposed, this proposal should be updated and expanded to include the technical fields involved in Elastos infrastructure.

## Types

- **Standard Track ELIP**

  The description also relates to changes in the design and implementation of Elastos infrastructure, which have a global impact, such as the modification of blockchain consensus, the modification of network protocols, and the modification of service interfaces.
  In general, whether a modification or suggestion is to be submitted as an ELIP can be measured by the following criteria:   If the modification or recommendation is only for a single application, it shouldn’t be raised as an ELIP;   if the modification or recommendation involves a platform common behavior or standard, it recommnets or mandates the platform and all applications to support, then it should be submitted as an ELIP.
  The standards tracking ELIP is divided into two parts: design and implementation. The design part should provide basic technical specifications and basic principles as well as implementation guidance. The implementation part is to track the status of the ELIP implementation.
  
- **Process ELIP**

  Describes a process surrounding Elastos, or proposes a change to a process. The process ELIP is similar to the Standards ELIP, but it is applicable to areas other than Elastos platform technology. Implementations may also be proposed in the ELIP, but should not involve changes to the Elastos platform codebase.
  In general, the Process ELIP needs to get community consensus. Unlike the information ELIP, the Process ELIP is more than recommendation, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environments used in Elastos development. ELIP-1 (this proposal) belongs to the process ELIP.
  
- **Informational ELIP**

  Describe the design issues of the Elastos, or provide general guidelines or information to the Elastos community, but does not propose new features. The informational ELIP does not necessarily represent the consensus or recommendation of the Elastos community, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational ELIP or follow their advice.

It is strongly recommended that a single ELIP contain only a single key recommendation or new idea, and the more focused the ELIP content is, the more likely it is to succeed. The ELIP must describe the proposal clearly and completely, and if the proposal involves improvements, it needs to clearly describe the improvement points. If the proposal contains an applicable implementation of the recommendation, the proposed implementation must be reliable and not overly complex.
