In this tutorial we will build the [Use Case Example: Decentralized Proof of Age](/services/did_sidechain/use_case_example).

#### This involves a few moving parts:

1. Alice must be able to create a DID with her name, digital photo hash and an endpoint service for the digital photo

2. Alice needs a private vault with granular permissions 

3. Company **"V"** must be able to create a Verifiable Credential

4. Alice must be able to generate a Verifiable Presentation from the Verifiable Credential

5. Bob needs to be able to scan the QR code, fetch her digital photo and verify the Verifiable Presentation without
    the issuer's help.
