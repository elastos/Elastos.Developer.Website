### 🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

Contributions are welcome and are greatly appreciated! **Every little bit helps**, and credit will always be given. 

The following is set of guidelines for contributing to all [Elastos repositories](https://github.com/elastos) hosted on Github. These are guidelines, not rules. So use your best judgement because some guidelines can differ due to used programming language.

## How Can I Contribute?

You can contribute in many ways! See how {{< internallink "here" "/resources/contribute/contribution_guides/_index.md" >}}.

## How to get in touch / get answers?
 
 * **Join** the [Elastos Community Telegram](https://t.me/elastosgroup) for general questions.
    
> Even though Telegram is a chat service, sometimes it takes several hours for community members to respond &mdash; please be patient!
 
 * **Join** the [Elastos Developers Telegram](https://t.me/elastosdev) for more technical questions.

>Core Developers are not usually watching this channel. If you need to contact core team, please use Github.

 * **Create an issue** describing your problem in the [Elastos repository](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos) for direct talks with the core team.

 > Please don't file an issue to ask a question. Use social channels for questions.
