## The guide is now at the following repo:

#### Github Repo: [https://github.com/noderators/elastos-supernode-setup](https://github.com/noderators/elastos-supernode-setup)

If you don't know what the Elastos DPoS Supernode is we suggest you read this first: {{< externallink title="Learn - Elastos Overview" >}}/learn/overview/{{< /externallink >}}.

This guide is for anyone interested in running a DPoS Supernode, please note that only the top 108 nodes by on-chain voting are eligible to receive
rewards. However having more nodes on standby improves Elastos' security and we definitely don't discourage those who are curious and would like
to run one.

#### To see a list of current DPoS Supernodes visit our community run site: {{< externallink title="https://elanodes.com" >}}https://elanodes.com{{< /externallink >}}.
