## Building the ELA Node

{{< hero >}}
    {{< heroitem link="https://github.com/elastos/elastos.ELA" linkBlank="true" rightArrow="true">}}
        Our Elastos (ELA) Node is open-source on Github, you can build and deploy it yourself and
        directly connect it to our vast Elastos blockchain network.<br/>
        <br/>
        Click here to visit the Github repo:

## Using the ELA CLI

The {{< internallink "ELA CLI" "ela_cli.md" >}} is a command line interface that helps you interact with an ELA Mainchain node.

This tool is built at the same time as the ELA node (make command). You can find more details at our Github repo [https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.ELA.Client](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.ELA.Client).

Here are a few base features for this tool:

* ELA mainchain transactions
* Mainchain to sidechains ELA transactions

### Note

This tool is not intended to be used by regular application developers in the future. In the interim, it can help with transferring ELA among the Elastos chains, but this is a process that will be automated in a near future.
