## Data synchronization and storage

Use the nodeâ€™s RPC interface synchronize blocks and transactions, then save all the received blocks and transactions.
This process requires dealing with temporary fork blocks. If the blocks acquired by the height can't be connected with the local stored best chain, the highest local block should be regained until they're connected. The original block with the same height will be discarded.

## Recharge

To prevent the issue of temporary forking, it is recommended that more than 16 confirmations be considered as available transactions.

## Coin withdraw

The exchange maintains the UTXO set of every address to generate the currency transaction. The withdrawal transaction can be generated by the transaction utility.

## Reference

### ELA (mainchain) Node

<https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.ELA>

Standalone server to run a Elastos mainchain node.

#### Main net config file

<https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.ELA/blob/master/docs/mainnet_config.json.sample>

Download this file to the ELA node directory and rename it to **mainnet_config.json**

#### Test net config file

<https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.ELA/blob/master/docs/testnet_config.json.sample>

Download this file to the ELA node directory and rename it to **testnet_config.json**

### Running your node on mainnet or testnet

> ./ela --datadir data_mn --conf mainnet_config.json

or 

> ./ela --datadir data_tn --conf testnet_config.json

**datadir** is the output folder in which your node will store its files.

### Transaction utility

<https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.ELA.Utilities.Java>

Java service that runs on exchange servers or wallets that manage users private keys on the server side. Used to make and sign Elastos transactions, get and create private and public keys.

### RPC interface

<https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.ELA/blob/master/docs/jsonrpc_apis.md>

Get blocks and transactions

Send raw transaction

### ELA client

<https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.ELA/blob/master/docs/cli_user_guide.md>

This is a command line tool. Used for testing.

### ELA Locking transaction recognition

<https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.ELA/blob/master/docs/Locking_transaction_recognition.md>
