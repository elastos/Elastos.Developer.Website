{{< faqentry question="What is Elastos?" >}}
Elastos is the world’s leading provider of open source solutions, employing not only blockchain technology, but a peer-to-peer network for communication, decentralized data storage services, and a decentralized ID system for all digital assets. We are revolutionizing the Internet with Elastos. Now, we have a suite of services, including [Carrier](https://elastos.academy/carrier/), [Hive](https://elastos.academy/hive/), [Runtime](https://elastos.academy/runtime/), [Decentralized Identity](https://elastos.academy/did/), and [Blockchain](https://elastos.academy/mainchain/), among others. With Elastos technologies, developers and companies can successfully adapt as the world’s demand for data rights strengthens.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What is a network operating system?" >}}
A network operating system refers to a system that uses the internet as a base layer. The internet becomes the device. This system is extremely well secured and peer-to-peer. Your data and computing power are both on your device and on the internet.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Is Elastos a company?" >}}
No, it is a non-profit foundation.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Is it an open-source project?" >}}
Yes, it is free and everyone can view the code on GitHub.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Who are Elastos’s competitors at the moment? And what makes Elastos different from others?" >}}
EOS is called a blockchain operation system, but its development period and open source codes are much shorter than Elastos’ 17 years. Also, EOS is dependent on its main-chain, so no matter how optimized it becomes, its throughput is limited. Elastos can extend the throughput infinitely with flexible main-chain and side-chain solution. Meanwhile, Elastos Runtime can deliver the trust function of the blockchain to a user’s application (like a cell phone, laptop, etc), which applies the blockchain to various scenarios in daily life.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What is the biggest challenge for Elastos?" >}}
To make sure users can accept blockchain and understand the value of dApps, marketing development could be the biggest challenge.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="How are the work tasks allocated between Elastos teams in Beijing and Shanghai?" >}}
Elastos in Beijing is mainly responsible for the overall project operation and management in blockchain development. The Shanghai team works on OS development (Elastos runtime), including interface support with 3rd party applications. 
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Is there any impact from current government regulations?" >}}
No, Elastos private sales are not considered as a token sale by the Chinese government.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="When will Elastos publish English documents on github or other technical exchange platform?" >}}
Everything is already available on [https://github.com/elastos](https://github.com/elastos).
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What will be the future application cases in Elastos?" >}}
Because our vision is to provide users with a trustful environment using trustless computing based on each application scenarios and as well as on blockchain technology, we will definitely have a lot of potential future applications.

The followings are some example of the applications:

* Support point-to-point conversation, point-to-point document transfer through decentralized P2P communication.
* Support point-to-point business through decentralized payment.
* Support digital content APP, like: electronic books, games, video player. All digital assets can be protected in a trustful environment.
* Support applications about evidence, traceability to source, ID verification, etc. through trustful storage.

Our projects that are currently in the business phase include: point-to-point document transfer system in personal mobile phones, evidence for credit investigation, single ID verification platform, and traceability of luxury goods.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Did anybody ask the similarity and difference between Elastos and blockstack?" >}}
Blockstack realizes a decentralized browser based on distributed storage, and supply applications depending on browser. It combines encrypted, distributed storage and blockchain ID to make sure all the data belongs to the owner.

As for Elastos, we apply a similar method for digital assets storage. Users could apply for an ID for their digital assets on the blockchain, which guarantees the ownership of those digital contents. Based on the clarification of ownership, the digital contents will also be transferable and tradable. Finally, we make sure that all the digital contents can be used in trustable environment provided by Elastos Runtime. Even though it is decrypted, it cannot escape from Elastos Runtime operating environment, which guarantees that it will never disclose or damage the ownership of the digital contents.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What are the benefits of using ELA?" >}}
ELA fuels the entire Elastos ecosystem. ELA is the main chain’s base currency used for processing peer-to-peer payments, storing info on the DID Sidechain and executing smart contracts on ETH and NEO Sidechains. It is also used for the trading of digital goods throughout the entire ecosystem. Refer to [https://elastos.academy/ela-the-elastos-token/](https://elastos.academy/ela-the-elastos-token/) for more info.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What is the use case of ELA, the currency of Elastos?" >}}
{{< internallink "Elastos tokenomics." "elastos_blockchain/concepts/tokenomics.md" >}}
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Is a part of Elastos’ code copied from another project?" >}}
Some of the Onchain team members worked on both ontology and elastos early on to build the main chain code. This is why the main chain code for DNA and Elastos are similar. Keep in mind that these kind of practices are very common in the open source world and that the mainchain ELA is only a part of Elastos. Also, as of today, even the main chain code of Elastos does much more than what it looked like on its inception so it's unlike any other projects out there. Every sidechain and the development of the Runtime/Carrier comes from original code and is way more complex.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Does Elastos compete with Windows, iOS and Android?" >}}
No. Elastos will exist as an application (virtual machine) on smartphones and personal computers. You can utilize the new internet at the same time as your classic environment. You would just be doing this via your elastOS Browser(codename: Trinity) so Elastos Browser including all the apps built using Elastos still run on top of Windows, iOS and Android.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What are the different parts of Elastos?" >}}
* An internet browser: elastOS Browser(codename: Trinity)
* A virtual machine: Elastos Runtime
* A network: Elastos Carrier
* A blockchain: ELA and its sidechains
* A platform that allows connection to other blockchain services: Ethereum VM, 
    NEO VM, etc
* An operating system: Elastos OS, for the Internet of Things (IoT), etc
* A system for distributed computing, elastic compute
* A system for decentralised storage: Hive
* A completely secured environment
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What is elastic compute?" >}}
It is a system for distributed computing that uses the shared peer-to-peer network called Elastos Carrier.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What are the benefits of using this platform?" >}}
Threats and undesirable activity on the internet, such as malware, DDoS attacks, man in the middle attacks, trojan horses, network surveillance (NSA, etc), theft and collection of all kinds of data (cookies, etc), theft of intellectual property, spam and more are all avoided by Elastos’  highly secure, encrypted and peer-to-peer system.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What are the benefits to other blockchain projects to be of this ecosystem?" >}}
The benefit is to avoid all the dangers stated above or at least minimize the dangers.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Are Ethereum, NEO, nOS, Cardano, EOS, Wanchain, Icon, etc competitors?" >}}
No. These blockchains and their applications are in theory all accessible from Elastos and could benefit from this new environment as every one of these listed projects can be ported as sidechains to the ever growing Elastos ecosystem.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What is the difference between Elastos and EOS?" >}}
EOS profiles itself as a blockchain operating system but its development time and its open-source code are way shorter than those of Elastos, which already exists for 18 years. EOS gives you a software development kit (SDK) to interact with the blockchain and uses different methodologies while Elastos is both an SDK and a runtime environment (virtual machine) that allows the dApps to function with an extra layer of security. EOS is also completely reliant on its mainchain so no matter how optimized it is, its capacity is limited. Elastos can scale infinitely with its mainchain and flexible sidechain solution. On top of that, Elastos Runtime is trust zone that uses blockchain as a way to ensure this trust.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What are the similarities and differences between Elastos and Ethereum?" >}}
Ethereum has only one mainchain that is being pushed to its extreme limits in computing and scalability. Elastos proposes a mainchain and sidechains structure where the mainchain is solely responsible for ID verification and payments while the sidechains execute smart contracts to supports different applications and services. Ethereum has redundancy and network congestion problems.  The fact that all the data and code is placed on the mainchain causes a lot of data to be redundant in the primary storage. On Elastos the applications run in the Elastos Runtime. This method is more secure. All the data has to pass through trusted and verifiable channels. Elastos Runtime can come in multiple forms such as an independent OS, a virtual machine or a software development kit (SDK) that allows the integration of applications from other operating systems. On Ethereum, after the acquisition of the data, the dApps are executed on a user interface that can cause a risk  of exposing the data. Elastos is secured up until the hearth of your device. Because the dApps are not allowed to connect to the internet directly they are not subject to DDOS attacks.
{{< /faqentry >}}


{{< faqentry question="Why choose or utilize this environment to access blockchain services provided by Ethereum or Neo?" >}}
[Read this article](https://medium.com/elastos/elastos-cliff-notes-version-a305e92a7855)
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Why should the ethereum community work on making their own operating system when they can just use ETH smart contracts on Elastos? What‘s their incentive to do this?" >}}
The only value proposition of Ethereum is being a secure blockchain and having smart contracts. Now the ELA blockchain is even more secure through merged mining and supports not only ETH but also Neo smart contracts and every other VM can also be ported to Elastos. With Ethereum you are stuck with a single public chain which is prone to congestion like we have seen many times before already. Projects like ETH and BTC have proven to be very slow in adoption of new technology because of their governance systems, that‘s why there are hundreds of ETH and BTC forks/clones which no one is using.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Is it possible to access Ethereum, NEO, nOS, Cardano, EOS and more from the Elastos ecosystem?" >}}
Yes it is possible to access these blockchains and the functions they provide (e.g. smart contracts) once their VM has been ported as a sidechain onto Elastos. The original blockchain will then become a friendchain and atomic swaps will also be possible between Elastos blockchain and the friendchain.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Which blockchains will become a part of the Elastos ecosystem?" >}}
The compatibility with Ethereum and NEO, among others, is already in production as sidechains. Any current blockchain platforms can be ported as one of the sidechains of Elastos.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Who are the partners of Elastos?" >}}
Bitmain, META Union Alliance (avec BIT.GAME, Matrix AI Network (MAN), TrustNote (TTT), Achain, Aurora, and Elastos), IOEX, Weatherblock, Panda Green Energy, Origin Agritech, Reactor, HashWorld, Urban Catalyst & UK China Catalyst, Fresco, Huafu Group & Far Eastern Air Transport (FAT), Trust Credit Power (TCP), WeFilmChain, Zapya (Viewchain)…
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< todo "@NiuJingyu BPI Maybe unclear / outdated. To be checked" >}}

{{< faqentry question="Elastos is completely open source, what is to stop someone from copying the code and releasing it themselves?" >}}
There‘s something called a network effect and we already have hundred thousands of nodes active on the Elastos smart web. Besides that we have a head start of 18 years of development and a team of engineers and a community working on Elastos. All those things can‘t be copied easily.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What problems does this project solve?" >}}
This platform prevents more than 90% of the dangers on the internet, solves the problem of digital asset ownership and offers a certain amount of anonymity with an encrypted connection.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Is Elastos really decentralized?" >}}
[The mainchain of the blockchain, the sidechains, the applications, the data, will all be decentralized.](https://elanews.net/2018/07/09/community-writer-series-will-the-real-decentralized-app-please-stand-up/)
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="How many people work on the project?" >}}
For the moment more than 80 developers are active in China. On top of that, you can add all the developers that are part of the Cyber Republic and are spread all over the world.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="This is all good and well but it still seems really complicated." >}}
The foundation works on giving the user a pleasant user experience where possible. There will not be a lot of difference between surfing the classic internet and surfing on Elastos.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="This is all good and well but it still seems really ambitious." >}}
[There is an article called “Elastos’ Ambition”.](https://elanews.net/2018/05/15/community-writer-series-the-ambition-of-elastos/)
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What basic knowledge do you need to have to understand how Elastos works?" >}}
You need to have an understanding of how blockchain works of course (Bitcoin, Ethereum, PoW, PoS, smart contracts, etc) but you also need to know how the internet works (TCP/IP protocol, DNS service, firewall, etc) and have some basic knowledge about encrypted communication (PGP, private/public key, etc).
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Why use Elastos instead of another crypto asset?" >}}
Elastos offers a Browser and its various SDKs that are compatible on any device in the world, giving its unparalleled security to desktop computers, smartphones, autonomous vehicles, virtual/augmented reality  (VR/AR) platforms, connected devices (IoT) and smart routers.
{{< /faqentry >}}

On [GitHub](https://github.com/elastos),
By visiting the [Cyber Republic](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/)
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What will be the biggest challenge for Elastos?" >}}
This will not only be a challenge for Elastos but one for the whole ecosystem. To convince new users to accept blockchain and understand the benefits of dApps. As a community driven open-source project, the marketing towards developers will be crucial for the future of Elastos. We survive because of the community, we take care of the community, we listen to the community and even more so we work together as a community to build this ecosystem as best as we can.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="What are the future use cases of Elastos?" >}}
Because of our vision of giving the users an operating system they can trust which is adapted to their expectations and to blockchain technology, we will certainly have a lot of use cases such as:

* Peer-to-peer communication, sending files peer-to-peer through a 
		decentralized peer-to-peer communication system.
* Peer-to-peer business support through decentralized payments
* Digital asset support such as: e-books, videogames, videos, etc. All digital 
		assets can be protected in a trusted environment.
* Authentication of assets, ID verification, evidence/proof, etc through storage 
		of trusted data.
* A peer-to-peer file distribution system for personal smartphones
* Proof for credit scoring
* A platform for simple identity checks
* Traceability  of commodities
* An autonomous driving system 
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Does Elastos use any 3rd party code snippets, libraries, or source code?" >}}

Depends on the project. elastOS browser is based on chromium. Carrier uses lots of 3rd party libraries. Elastos mainchain is based on PoW and DPoS but merged mined so it borrows a lot of ideas from namecoin (that is also merged mined with bitcoin). The elastos runtime however is unique to elastos and is home grown

{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Who is testing SDK libraries for bugs?" >}}
The core internal team and then 3rd party for audits
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="How is code updated if bugs are found in release version?" >}}

Elastos Carrier serves as a way to automatically provide update services remotely in a decentralized manner. Eg. IoeX. Most of the calls being made from elastos apps are RPC calls so usually, if a bug is found within the blockchain code or carrier code, this can be automatically updated and pushed out similar to how bitcoin code is updated. If there’s a bug in elastOS browser itself(the runtime code), then a new version of the app needs to be pushed out via app store

{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Is there a bug bounty?" >}}

Yes, certainly. Please read more about it here:

{{< internallink "Elastos bounty programme" "contribute/why_contribute/bounty_programme.md" >}}

{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Will there be bug tracking outside of the github repository?" >}}

Unlikely. We’ll be using github for bug tracking. Maybe integrate github issue API to cyberrepublic.org someday but that’s not anytime soon

{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Who decides when to publish code updates?" >}}
At the moment, the elastos foundation but this will be transferred over to Cyber Republic eventually.
{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Are user preferences for Elastos Dapps stored and loaded from local memory or is this done through IPFS/Hive?" >}}

Hive is still in development so at the moment, it’s all loaded from local memory

{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="There is a security vulnerability created by office printers, fax machines, and scanner-copiers. The problem is that data you send to these devices are stored on in drives in these devices and can be hacked for the data. Given that some Elastos apps will use these devices, can any part of Elastos prevent those devices from being hacked?" >}}

Elastos apps run inside elastos runtime environment so this means that data will never get out of this sandbox environment so you won’t be able to print from elastos dapps at all nor store them in these devices unless they have elastos carrier in them and are acting as a node that stores data. In which case, the data would not leak either as everything is encrypted

{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="I would like to create 1000 copies of a digital asset movie on elastos. The movie will have a unique ID stored in the DID side chain. Suppose that one user wants to sell the movie: 1) is the file’s copy from the same physically different from each other? (Mean that do we need to download the exact specific file from the seller’s device?). Or each copy is the same exact file (so everyone can download it but only few who have ownership via DID can watch the movie). 2) how can the user download the file after he bought it if the seller doesn’t have any IPFS or private cloud space? 3) when I want to see the downloaded movie, DID verification will launch first. So is it possible to launch the movie without internet? 4) where can he sell the movie? if we have something like a market place, does it act like a central place/ middle man and have the mopopoly (with restrictons/ fees.. ) ?" >}}

1) Each copy of a movie is an actual APPLICATION. It's NOT an .mp4 file or whatever. It's an actual application so you're selling application from one person to another. Each application has a unique ID and when the author first creates those 1000 copies, all the IDs along with ownership are already recorded on the blockchain and stored on Hive

2) The user can't download the file. He has to buy it from someone else same as buying bitcoin but buying an application in this case. The content of that movie is already stored on Hive

3) Not possible. The application cannot check your DID unless it's connected to the internet as it needs to connect to the blockchain since that's where DID is stored

4) Like a digital market place like a DEX but for movies

{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="In order for a transation to be effective, user needs to download the whole app file. So what happens if the app is huge like 1GB? Does the seller need to wait for the user to finish his download to receive money? What happen if we lose our application movie: eg by deleting it from the computer to get more space?" >}}

It's like downloading an app on your mobile phone right now. When you go to your app, is the data on facebook really stored on your own device? Nope. You just download the app and this app contains the code to check the ID and ownership of this app. The data is stored on Hive. If you lose your application, you just use your private key to access your app again. That is what your ownership is tied with. Just like restoring your online wallet.

{{< /faqentry >}}

{{< faqentry question="Selling ownership and downloading data will be a 2 step process like buying an app on appstore : first pay for the ownership and second download the dapp. So with Hive and elastos is it possible to be run out of seeders?" >}}

Theoretically yea, it's possible. But even that tv box is already in over 230,000 hands and all of them can be utilized to be part of the Hive network in the future. Imagine when Carrier starts getting integrated in not just TV boxes but also other smart devices all over the world and in other computing environments. The network effect will be compounded and there will be more than enough nodes to keep the network running.
