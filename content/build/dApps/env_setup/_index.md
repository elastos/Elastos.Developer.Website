### PrivateNet, TestNet and MainNet

Before we get started we need to explain how the typical development flow works in dApp development, and the reasons
it is set up this way.

- Remember that on the blockchain running any computations, deploying smart contracts or just about anything costs real money 
in the form of __cryptocurrency__.

#### Therefore to save on costs we develop locally on what some people call a "Private Net".

A private net is a local blockchain that mimics the real blockchain, but you get unlimited cryptocurrency and it also runs much faster.
Of course that cryptocurrency is not of any value outside of your private net, but this allows you to freely test and develop your
dApp.

        This is the first step, getting things running locally on your machine.
