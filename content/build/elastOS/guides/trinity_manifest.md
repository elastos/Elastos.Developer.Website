A capsule manifest is **the main descriptor** for the elastOS runtime to learn more about the capsule, know how to start it, know which services to start or which intents are supported. Here is the manifest format:

## Manifest Format 

```js
{
    "id": "com.mycompany.myapp", // Permanent app identifier. If you change it, your app will be considered as a new app.
    "version": "0.0.1", // Version displayed to end users.
    "version_code": 1, // Internal version number. Used to compare versions (newer, older). Increase it every time you publish a new version.
    "name": "My App",   // Your application name (app store)
    "short_name": "My App", // Your application name (home screen)
    "description": "My Sample App", // Application description (app store, settings)
    "start_url": "index.html", // Location of your starting ionic html file. Usually index.html but can be a local URL in case of remote debugging
    "type":"file",  // local "file", or remote "url"
    "category":"finance", // Application category in the app store such as entertainment, games, health, productivity...
    "icons": [ // Array of icons (home screen). Use different size variants if needed, but 512 x 512 is the recommended default choice.
    {
        "src": "logo.png",

        "type": "image/png"
    }
    ],

       "email": "myname@mycompany.com"  // App developer's email (public on the app store)
    },

    },

        {
            "action": "connectapplicationprofile"
        }
    ]
}
```
