We do not provide native support for windows. Nevertheless, windows developers can use the Trinity CLI using Windows 10 WSL (Linux support). 

WSL can install a minimal version of Linux Ubuntu inside windows 10. After that, you can start a linux terminal and setup/run Trinity-CLI.

In order for adb, the android communication tool, to work through WSL, you will have to install the android SDK, **same version**, on both your windows host and the Ubuntu guest (for both ADBs being able to share the same daemon instance).

* Read the WSL howto there: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 (Install Ubuntu)
* Launch ubuntu in WSL (from a windows powershell):

```
wsl.exe
```

Note that when using WSL, Ubuntu can access your windows files from **/mnt/c/**.

* Setup your ubuntu environment:

```
# Base requirements 
sudo apt -y install openjdk-8-jdk build-essential curl dirmngr apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates
# Install NodeJS 12 instead of 8 or 10
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt -y install nodejs
```

* Go to https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads -> download options -> command line tools only.
* Download both windows and linux ZIP files.
* Unzip both ZIP files.
* Install android platform tools using the SDK manager (on both windows and linux):

```
    [extracted_android_tools_folder]/tools/bin/sdkmanager "platform-tools"
``` 

A **platform-tools** folder gets created at the root of [extracted_android_tools_folder]

* Add adb to windows and linux paths:
    * **In Ubuntu**: Add [extracted_android_tools_folder]/platform-tools to your PATH in ~/.bashrc
    * **In Windows**: Add [extracted_android_tools_folder]/platform-tools to system environment variables using "view advanced system settings".
* Verify that adb has the same version on both windows and ubuntu:

**First on windows** (to start the daemon on windows), then on ubuntu:

```
adb --version
```

* Launch the ADB daemon (always on windows first):
    * Plug your android device on USB
    * First on windows: adb devices
    * Then on linux: adb devices
    * You should be able to see your device ID in the list
