### Introduction

To start building apps on Elastos, you first need to get your development environment ready, then get your app ready.

### The environment

The first one is the **environment**: install development tools, connect to the testnet, get test ELA, and more. But don't worry, we tried to make this as easy as possible for you.

### Your project

The second part is **project** specific, in order to get your android/ios/web/etc project ready to call Elastos APIs.

### Deployment

When you are ready to go live, there are a few additional steps to reach the mainnet.
